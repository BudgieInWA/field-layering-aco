Installing
==========
Requires node.js and some node packages:
	$ npm install commander canvas

Running
=======
Run aco.js as a script:
	$ node aco.js --help

Some commands don't run exactly as advertised.

Hacking
=======
Start with aco.js.

To run an aco, you need to combine a construction graph (such as that in tripod-construction.js) and
an ACO (such as ACO in aco.js).

plot.py
-------
This script takes a json file as input and plots all of the arrays in it.
